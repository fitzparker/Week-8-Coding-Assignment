 <h2>Why Choose ProFinish Renovations?</h2> 
    <p class="cursivetext">We have two decades experience in interior/exterior remodeling at ProFinish Renovations. My name is Ross Parker and I am the owner and lead of all residential projects.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I entered the construction field when I was just 17 years old and fell in love with it. When I started out, I was simply a painter for my father, this trade eventually turned into a lead role with our family-owned business.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After a few years of painting, I became curious about other trades and decided to part ways from my father's business and create my own path.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Over the past 20 years, I have expanded my knowledge in all aspects of remodeling on interior/exterior spaces. While I do not build new construction homes, I have mastered nearly every trade that can make any space look new!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I take great pride in the work we do and treat all jobs the same, big or small. I also take great pride in customer satisfaction and I work diligently to ensure a solid and beautiful end result.
        We will not leave your job unattended with contractors to do the work you hired me to do. I will be present on the job from start to finish to ensure we both have the results all customers desire!</p>
